              . Three years ago, I started building a medtech startup that could
              save lives. I&apos;ve invested everything â€” my savings, my time,
              my sanity â€” into making it real.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Plot twist: Hardware is expensive. Regulatory approval takes
              forever. My runway is getting shorter by the day. But instead of
              giving up, I&apos;m doing what I do best â€” shipping websites.
              Every project I take on directly funds my mission to revolutionize
              healthcare.

              alive, one website at a time.
