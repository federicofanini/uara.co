# Welcome to My Development Blog!

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my corner of the internet where I share thoughts, insights, and tutorials about **web development**, **startup building**, and everything in between.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is where I document my journey as a developer and founder. Expect to find:

- **Technical tutorials** on Next.js, React, and modern web development
- **Performance optimization** tips and tricks
- **Startup insights** from building products and services
- **Development workflows** and productivity tips
- **Real-world case studies** from client projects

## My Background

I'm Federico, a developer and founder passionate about creating fast, beautiful websites. I run **uara**, a subscription-based web development service where I build websites using modern technologies like:

- Next.js & React
- Tailwind CSS & Shadcn UI
- Supabase & Prisma
- Stripe & payment integrations

## Why This Blog?

Building in public is something I strongly believe in. This blog serves multiple purposes:

1. **Knowledge sharing** - Help other developers learn and grow
2. **SEO boost** - Improve search rankings through quality content
3. **Community building** - Connect with fellow developers and founders
4. **Personal growth** - Document learnings and reflect on progress

## What's Coming Next?

I'm planning to share deep-dives into:

- React Server Components and how they're changing web development
- Web performance optimization strategies that actually work
- Building scalable Next.js applications from scratch
- Real client project breakdowns and lessons learned
