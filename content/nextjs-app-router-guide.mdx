# Next.js App Router: The Complete 2025 Guide

If you're building a modern SaaS or subscription platform, **Next.js App Router** is your new best friend. It gives you cleaner routing, better SEO, and server components out of the box.

This guide covers everything you need to know to master the App Router in 2025.

## Why It Matters

- **Server Components** = faster apps with better performance
- **Folder-based routing** = intuitive file system routing
- **SEO-ready** = built-in metadata API for better indexing
- **Streaming support** = progressive page loading for smoother UX
- **Type safety** = full TypeScript integration out of the box

## Example Folder Structure

```bash
app/
  layout.tsx          # Root layout component
  page.tsx           # Home page
  dashboard/
    page.tsx         # Dashboard page
    settings/
      page.tsx       # Settings page
```

Each folder = one route. Nest as deep as you like.

## SEO With Metadata API

The new App Router makes SEO easier:

```typescript
export async function generateMetadata() {
  return {
    title: "My SaaS Dashboard",
    description: "Built with Next.js App Router, Supabase, and Prisma.",
  };
}
```
